    Express is a web framework. It is fast, unopinionated, minimalist. Express is the first web framework build for Nodejs.

    Express framework can be used for creating a web application, REST API server or both.

## Creating an express application
1. Install express using npm. Then manually create express server from scratch and configure it.

2. Use express-generator for creating an express application. It comes with server configuration out of the box.
    `npm install --global express-generator`
    `express <project_name>`
    or
    `npx express-generator <project_name>`
